# 🏗️ Engineering Protocols

> **Lean systems. Elite quality. No excess.**

---

### 👋 Community Note: Welcome!

This repository contains my personal, high-fidelity engineering protocols and agentic workflows. It is **highly personalized** to my specific development environment (Windows PowerShell, specific project structures, and AI agent interactions).

I am sharing this publicly to **provide value to the community**, showing how a senior principal engineer might orchestrate complex, multi-state AI behaviors to maintain elite code quality. 

**Feel free to use it!**
If you'd like to adopt these patterns for your own projects, you are encouraged to **Fork** this repository.

## 👑 The Director: `GEMINI.md`

`GEMINI.md` is the **Global Ruler** and core source of truth. It defines the mandate of the **Director (Senior Principal Engineer)** and establishes the strategic foundation. 

Every action taken by any agent in the ecosystem MUST align with the philosophy and constraints defined in this document.

## 🔄 Workflow Ecosystem

This directory contains specialized markdown files that define the execution steps for each slash command. These are the "Brains" of the specialized actors.

### The Core Sequence:
1.  **`/brainstormer`**: Idea Exploration & Feature Discovery.
2.  **`/architect`**: Initial Project Architecture & Foundation Design.
3.  **`/starter`**: Project Scaffolding & Base Connectivity.
4.  **`/builder`**: High-Fidelity Implementation.
5.  **`/tester`**: Testing, Coverage & Error Hygiene.
6.  **`/commit`**: Atomic Commit Protocol & Standardized History.
7.  **`/merger`**: Linear Integration & Release Consolidation.
8.  **`/deployer`**: Environment Synchronization & Remote Push.

### The Guardians:
- **`/auditor`**: Ruthless review of logic, debt, and architectural integrity.
- **`/security`**: Advanced security auditing and pragmatic skepticism.
- **`/sentinel`**: The Isolation Expert. Audits and enforces infrastructure isolation.

### Special Operations:
- **`/planner`**: Incremental feature implementation and system iteration.
- **`/releaser`**: Production release gatekeeping and CI/CD orchestration.
