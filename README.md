# Engineering Protocols

Lean systems. Elite quality. No excess.

## 👑 The Director: `GEMINI.md`

`GEMINI.md` is the **Global Ruler** and core source of truth for this system. It defines the mandate of the **Director (Senior Principal Engineer)** and establishes the strategic foundation for all operations. 

Every action taken by the agent must align with the philosophy and constraints defined in `GEMINI.md`.

Directory: C:\Users\USER\.gemini\

## 🔄 Workflow Execution Order

To maintain high-fidelity standards and ensure strategic clarity, workflows should follow this standard sequence:

1.  **`/brainstormer`**: Idea Exploration & Feature Discovery.
2.  **( `/architect` or `/planner` )**: Technical Architecture & Critical Implementation Design.
3.  **`/builder`**: Primary Implementation & Feature Development.
4.  **`/commit`**: Atomic Commit Protocol & Quality Standards.
5.  **`/auditor`**: Ruthless Code & Architecture Audit.
6.  **`/security`**: Advanced Security Auditing.
7.  **`/tester`**: Testing, Coverage & Error Hygiene.
8.  **`/merger`**: Verification, Versioning, Local Integration & Workspace Cleanup.
9.  **`/deployer`**: Local Environment Refresh, Infrastructure Orchestration & Remote Push.
10. **`/releaser`**: Production Release & Deployment.

## 🚀 Special Scenarios

### 🌱 Starting a New Project
When initializing a codebase from scratch, the scaffolding phase is inserted after architectural planning:
`brainstormer` → **`/architect`** → **`/starter`** → `builder` → ...

### 🔄 Pivoting Project Direction
If the strategic direction changes or a major refactor is needed, the audit precedes the new plan:
**`/auditor`** → **`/planner`** → `builder` → ...
